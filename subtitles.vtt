1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.670
The.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.019
I'm a little like friend,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.020
but really I.

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.439
Looking here in the alley.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.459
The light switch.

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.460
Who watches the.

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.869
Make a little birdhouse in your

8
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.849
soul. Not to put too fine a point

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.179
on it.

10
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.409
And say I'm the only.

11
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.089
Thing in your body.

12
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.090
Make a little.

13
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.109
I have a.

14
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.669
Secret to tell.

15
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.899
From my lecture.

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.909
Go. Well, it's a simple

17
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.859
message, and I'm leaving

18
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.829
out the whistles and.

19
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.319
So the rumors listen to me.

20
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.629
Filibuster vigilantly.

21
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.630
My name.

22
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.269
Everyone knows well how I

23
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.770
treat my.

24
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.530
You can hear me in the.

25
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.870
Who are you?

26
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.299
Here.

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.279
So not to put too fine a point

28
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.319
on it and say, I'm the only man

29
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.489
you're gonna.

30
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.490
Make a little.

31
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.809
But I'm a little glowing

32
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.489
friend. But really, I'm.

33
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.499
But I am.

34
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.869
There's a picture of us and me

35
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.309
and the primitive and.

36
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.169
Street, which stood on

37
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.479
rocky shores and kept the beaches

38
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.109
shipwreck free.

39
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.489
Though I respect that a lot.

40
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.939
I'd be fired if that were my job.

41
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.899
After killing Jason.

42
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.560
And countless screaming I can.

43
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.489
Make a little birdhouse in your

44
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.499
soul. Not to put too fine a point

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.539
on it. Say I the only be in

46
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.540
your bonnet.

47
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.110
House in your soul.

48
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.399
Not to put too fine.

49
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.439
A point on it to say I'm the only

50
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.820
thing in your bonnet.

51
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.930
While you're riding a jeep.

52
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.999
Yourself not to.

53
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.709
Put too fine a point on it.

54
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.819
Say I'm gonna.

55
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.100
Be in your body.

56
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.779
Here. So.

57
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.489
While you're at it, which means it's

58
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.490
not.

59
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.099
Not to put too fine a point on it.

60
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.269
Say I'm the only.

61
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.409
Be in your body.
