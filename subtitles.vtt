00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
I'm your only friend

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.480
I'm not your only friend, but I'm a little glowing friend

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.000
But really, I'm not actually your friend, but I am

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.080
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch

5
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.560
Who watches over you?

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.160
Make a little bird house in your soul

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.080
Not to put too fine a point on it

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.720
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.240
Make a little bird house in you soul, I have

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.760
a secret to tell from my electrical well.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.560
It's a simple message, and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.080
So the room must listen to me, fillibuster vigilantly

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.040
My name is blue canary one note, spelled L-I-T-E

14
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.400
My story's infinite, like the Longines Symphonette

15
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.480
It doesn't rest. Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch

16
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.960
Who watches over you?

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.520
Make a little bird house in your soul, not to put too fine a point on it

18
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:1.960
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet

19
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:31.4920
Make a little bird house in your soul

20
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm your only friend

21
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.160
I'm not your only friend, but I'm a little glowing friend

22
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.280
But really, I'm not actually your friend, but I am

23
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.640
There's a picture opposite me of my primitive ancestry

24
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.600
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck-free

25
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.080
Though I respect that a lot, I'd be fired if that were my job after

26
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.480
killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts

27
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.400
Blue bird of friendliness, like guardian angels, it's always near

28
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.200
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch, who watches over you?

29
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.760
Make a little bird house in your soul, not to put too fine a point on it

30
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.320
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet

31
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
Make a little bird house

32
00:02:27.200 --> 00:03:12.760
In your soul, while you're at it, leave the night light on inside the bird house in your soul
